# 🎯 CRM Implementation - Complete Checklist

## ✅ COMPLETED (Priority 1 - Critical)

### Phase 1.1: Mirror Admin UI to Agent Panel ✅
- [x] **MyLeads.tsx completely rewritten** to match LeadsManager.tsx structure

---

## 🟡 PARTIALLY COMPLETE (Needs Verification)

### Phase 3: Lead Distribution & Assignment 🟡
**Status:** Database infrastructure exists, needs testing

**Already Implemented:**
- [x] Database function: `get_least_busy_agent()` - returns least busy agent
- [x] Trigger: `tg_leads_before_insert()` - auto-assigns on lead creation
- [x] Trigger: `tg_leads_after_insert()` - logs assignment history
- [x] Table: `assignment_history` - tracks all assignments
- [x] Function: `reassign_overdue_leads()` - handles SLA breaches
- [x] Manual reassignment by admin supported

**Needs Verification:**
- [ ] Test round-robin with 5+ new leads across 3+ agents
- [ ] Verify assignment history is logged correctly
- [ ] Test manual admin reassignment triggers notifications
- [ ] Verify load balancing (no agent gets >2x more than another)

**Optional Enhancement (Not Critical):**
- [ ] Admin UI for assignment rules configuration
- [ ] Toggle auto-assign on/off
- [ ] Set max leads per agent
- [ ] View assignment statistics dashboard

---

## ⚠️ NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION (Priority 2-3)

### Phase 4: Tasks & Outcomes Synchronization 🔴
**Status:** Database functions exist, UI enforcement needed

**Database Layer (Already Complete):**
- [x] `apply_followup_outcome()` - raises exception for terminal statuses
- [x] `ensure_manual_followup()` - blocks task creation for Won/Lost/Invalid
- [x] `log_call_outcome()` - handles call outcomes and auto-tasks

**UI Layer (Needs Implementation):**
- [ ] Disable "Create Task" button when `lead.status in ['won', 'lost']`
- [ ] Disable "Create Task" button when `lead.custom_fields?.invalid === true`
- [ ] Show warning message: "Cannot create tasks for closed leads"
- [ ] Update `TaskCreationDialog.tsx` with status checks
- [ ] Update `LeadDetailDrawer.tsx` to show disabled state
- [ ] Test: Verify task creation blocked at UI level
- [ ] Test: Verify status change from Won→New re-enables tasks

**Files to Modify:**
```
src/components/leads/TaskCreationDialog.tsx
src/components/leads/LeadDetailDrawer.tsx (already has isTerminalStatus check)
src/components/leads/LeadOutcomeDialog.tsx
```

### Phase 7: Permissions & Security Testing 🟡
**Status:** RLS policies exist, needs comprehensive testing

**Database Security (Already Implemented):**
- [x] Leads RLS: Agents can only SELECT/UPDATE their leads
- [x] Properties RLS: Agents can only manage their properties
- [x] Calendar Events RLS: Filtered by agent_id
- [x] Tasks RLS: Filtered by assigned_to
- [x] Profiles RLS: User-based access
- [x] User Roles: Stored in separate table (secure)
- [x] Security audit logging: `log_security_event()` function

**Security Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] **Test:** Agent cannot see other agent's leads
- [ ] **Test:** Agent cannot edit other agent's properties
- [ ] **Test:** Agent cannot create other agents
- [ ] **Test:** Agent cannot access admin-only functions
- [ ] **Test:** Admin can see/edit everything
- [ ] **Test:** Assignment history logs all changes
- [ ] **Test:** Security audit logs are created
- [ ] **Test:** Try SQL injection on search fields
- [ ] **Test:** Try privilege escalation (change role in localStorage)
- [ ] **Test:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention

### Phase 8: Data Integrity & Testing 🟡
**Status:** Database triggers exist, needs comprehensive testing

**Data Sync (Already Implemented):**
- [x] Trigger: `sync_lead_contact_data()` - bidirectional sync
- [x] Trigger: `update_contact_status_from_lead()` - auto status updates
- [x] Foreign keys enforce relationships
- [x] RLS policies enforce data access

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] **Test:** Create lead → Contact created
- [ ] **Test:** Update lead → Contact updated
- [ ] **Test:** Lead Won → Contact becomes "active_client"
- [ ] **Test:** Lead Lost → Contact becomes "past_client"
- [ ] **Test:** Delete lead (check orphaned tasks/events)
- [ ] **Test:** Delete agent (verify leads aren't orphaned)
- [ ] **Test:** Real-time sync propagation (<1 second)
- [ ] **Test:** No duplicate tasks for same lead
- [ ] **Test:** Foreign key integrity maintained
- [ ] **Load Test:** 1000+ leads, verify performance (<2 sec load)
- [ ] **Load Test:** Real-time updates don't cause UI lag
- [ ] **Memory Test:** No memory leaks from subscriptions

## 📝 NOT YET STARTED (Lower Priority)

### Phase 3.2: Assignment Rules Configuration UI 🔵
**Status:** Optional enhancement (not critical for MVP)

**Features to Build:**
- [ ] Admin panel component: `AssignmentRulesDialog.tsx`
- [ ] Toggle: Auto-assign mode on/off
- [ ] Input: Max leads per agent
- [ ] Display: Agent availability status
- [ ] Display: Assignment statistics (leads per agent)
- [ ] Save rules to database table: `assignment_config`
- [ ] Load rules on lead creation

**Location:** Add to Admin Panel or Team Management page

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Do Next)

### 1. Terminal Status Task Blocking (Highest Priority) 🔴
**Why:** Critical UX bug - users can create tasks for closed leads

**Steps:**
1. Open `src/components/leads/TaskCreationDialog.tsx`
2. Add prop: `isTerminalStatus: boolean`
3. Add check:
   ```typescript
   if (isTerminalStatus) {
     return (
       <div className="text-yellow-800 bg-yellow-50 p-4 rounded">
         ⚠️ Cannot create tasks for closed leads (Won/Lost/Invalid)
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
4. Update `LeadDetailDrawer.tsx` to pass `isTerminalStatus` prop
5. Test with Won, Lost, and Invalid leads

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

### 2. Security Testing (High Priority) ⚠️
**Why:** Must verify no data leakage between agents

**Steps:**
1. Create 2 test agent accounts (Agent A, Agent B)
2. Login as Agent A, create 3 leads
3. Login as Agent B, verify cannot see Agent A's leads
4. Try direct URL access: `/leads?id={agentA_lead_id}`
5. Check network tab for unauthorized queries
6. Verify RLS policies are enforced

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### 3. Round-Robin Assignment Testing (High Priority) ⚠️
**Why:** Core feature must work flawlessly

**Steps:**
1. Create 3 test agents (Agent 1, 2, 3)
2. Create 10 new leads (don't assign manually)
3. Verify distribution is balanced (3-4 leads each)
4. Check `assignment_history` table for logs
5. Test manual reassignment by admin
6. Verify agent receives notification

**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes

### 4. Real-Time Sync Verification (Medium Priority) 🟡
**Why:** Confirm instant propagation works

**Steps:**
1. Open 2 browser windows (Admin + Agent)
2. Admin assigns lead to Agent
3. Verify toast notification appears in Agent window
4. Verify lead appears in Agent's list without refresh
5. Admin reassigns lead to different agent
6. Verify lead disappears from first agent's list

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes
